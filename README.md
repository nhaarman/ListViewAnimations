ListViewAnimations ([Play Store Demo][1])
===========

ListViewAnimations is an Open Source Android library that allows developers to easily create ListViews with animations.
Feel free to use it all you want in your Android apps provided that you cite this project and include the license in your app.

ListViewAnimations uses the [NineOldAndroids][2] library to support devices <3.0.  
It also uses Roman Nurik's BETA [SwipeDismissListViewTouchListener][5] to support swipe to dismiss.

Known applications using ListViewAnimations
-----
* TreinVerkeer ([Play Store][6])

If you want your app to be listed as well please contact me via [Twitter][7] or [Google Plus][8]!

Setup
-----
* In Eclipse, just import the library as an Android library project.
* Project > Clean to generate the binaries you need, like R.java, etc.
* Then, just add ListViewAnimations as a dependency to your existing project and you're good to go!

Or:

* [Download the .jar file][4]
* Add the .jar to your project's `libs` folder.

Usage
-----
This library uses the [Decorator Pattern][3] to stack multiple `BaseAdapterDecorator`s on each other:

* Implement your own `BaseAdapter`, or reuse an existing one.
* Stack multiple `BaseAdapterDecorator`s on each other, with your `BaseAdapter` as a base.
* Set the `ListView` to your last `BaseAdapterDecorator`.
* Set your last `BaseAdapterDecorator` to the `ListView`.

Example:
-----

	/* This example will stack two animations on top of eachother */
	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

		MyListAdapter mAdapter = new MyListAdapter(this, getItems());
		SwingBottomInAnimationAdapter swingBottomInAnimationAdapter = new SwingBottomInAnimationAdapter(mAdapter);
		SwingRightInAnimationAdapter swingRightInAnimationAdapter = new SwingRightInAnimationAdapter(swingBottomInAnimationAdapter);
		
		// Or in short notation:
		swingRightInAnimationAdapter = 
			new SwingRightInAnimationAdapter(
				new SwingBottomInAnimationAdapter(
						new MyListAdapter(this, getItems())));
		
		// Assign the ListView to the AnimationAdapter and vice versa
		swingRightInAnimationAdapter.setListView(getListView());
		getListView().setAdapter(swingRightInAnimationAdapter);
	}
	
	private class MyListAdapter extends com.haarman.listviewanimations.ArrayAdapter<String> {

		private Context mContext;

		public MyListAdapter(Context context, ArrayList<String> items) {
			super(items);
			mContext = context;
		}

		@Override
		public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
			TextView tv = (TextView) convertView;
			if (tv == null) {
				tv = (TextView) LayoutInflater.from(mContext).inflate(R.layout.list_row, parent, false);
			}
			tv.setText(getItem(position));
			return tv;
		}
	}

Custom AnimationAdapters
-----
Instead of using the ready-made adapters in the `.swinginadapters.prepared` package, you can also implement your own `AnimationAdapter`.
Implement one of the following classes:

* `ResourceAnimationAdapter`
* `SingleAnimationAdapter`
* `AnimationAdapter`

See the examples.
