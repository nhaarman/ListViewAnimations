Setup
-----

The library consists of separate modules:

* `lib-core`: The core of the library, and contains appearance animations.
* `lib-manipulation`: Contains the item manipulation options, such as Swipe-to-Dismiss, and Drag-and-Drop.
* `lib-core-slh`: An extension of `lib-core` to support `StickyListHeaders`.

When using `lib-manipulation` or `lib-core-slh`, `lib-core` is included as well.

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	}
	
	dependencies {
		compile 'com.nhaarman.listviewanimations:lib-core:3.1.0@aar'
		compile 'com.nhaarman.listviewanimations:lib-manipulation:3.1.0@aar'
		compile 'com.nhaarman.listviewanimations:lib-core-slh:3.1.0@aar'
	}

    * [`lib-core`][8]
    * [`lib-manipulation`][9]
    * [`lib-core-slh`][10]
* [Download the latest NineOldAndroids .jar file][6]
* Add the .jar files to your project's `libs` folder, or add them as external jars to your project's build path.
