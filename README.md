Special Thanks
-----
* Roman Nurik - The ListViewAnimations library uses a modified version of his [SwipeDismissListViewTouchListener][5] to support swipe-to-dismiss.
* DevBytes - Drag-and-Drop reordering is done by a modified version of their [DynamicListView][16].
* Jake Warthon - To support devices pre-HC (<3.0), a jar file of [NineOldAndroids][2] is included.
* Emil Sjölander - If you're already using the [StickyListHeaders][14] library, the ListViewAnimations library makes sure your header views are animated as well. Therefore, a copy of the StickyListHeaders jar file is included.
